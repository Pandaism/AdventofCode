# Advent of Code - 2018 in JAVA
https://adventofcode.com/2018

## Introduction
Advent of Code is an advent calender updated with programming challenges every day in December until Dec 25th.
I decided to join the challenge as it starts this year after feeling confident enough about my problem solving skills.

## Information
I am unable to start challenges at the schedule release time due to my work schedule and will be doing them whenever I can. The
code pushed to the repo is the code, I use to solve the problem and I will try to make it look cleaner and optimized on days I 
do not work and have finish the day challenge. I will also be planning on solving the challenge on Python and C++ to practice 
those languages.
